# SSO Integration Settings

In order to use this package you must first have an SSO integration from the Common Hosted Single Sign-On ([CSS]) Service that is set up with a [CSS API Account].

If you're looking for the `CSS_API_CLIENT_ID`, `CSS_API_CLIENT_SECRET`, or `SSO_INTEGRATION_ID` values, you will find the first two by going to `My Teams`, selecting your team, clicking on the `CSS API Account` tab, and clicking the copy or download icons under `Actions` in your SSO dashboard. The `SSO_INTEGRATION_ID` can be found as `Request ID` under `Integrations` in the `My Projects` tab.

## Requirements:

- Create a [CSS API Account].
