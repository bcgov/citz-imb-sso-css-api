# CITZ IMB SSO CSS API (NPM Package)
<!-- This file is the homepage of your documentation. It is mandatory and must not be deleted. --->
## Overview

This npm package offers the CSS (Common Hosted Single Sign-on) API Account functionality through easy to use functions in your NodeJS application. The CSS API Account is part of the B.C. government's Single Sign-On SSO (CSS) service and is used to manage your SSO integrations through code instead of through the dashboard. This can be used to add or remove user roles and much more. Endpoints in the CSS API are offered as JavaScript functions in this package.

- Built for a NodeJS:20 React app.
- For [CSS] Teams with a [CSS API Account].
- Works with Vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript 5.
- Built for standalone use. Does NOT require [@bcgov/citz-imb-sso-react] or [@bcgov/citz-imb-sso-express]

!!! warning "Important"
    This package leverages, rather than replicates, Common Hosted Single Sign-On ([CSS]) API.  
    It allows our own applications to make use of the [CSS API Account] in an easy to consume way.  
    It is developed and maintained by the [CITZ IMB Common Code] team, separate from the Common Hosted Single Sign-On ([CSS]) team.

!!! tip "Tip"
    If you don't have a [CSS API Account] check out [SSO Settings & CSS API Account](./getting-started/sso-settings.md).
